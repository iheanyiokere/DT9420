KEY FEATURES OF PYTHON
	Its easy to code and read.
	Python is free and open source.
	Python code doesn't change across operating systems.
PROBLEMS PYTHON HAS FACED 
	Errors due to updated language.
	Dependant on the compiler been used.
	It gets slow. 
SOME SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS BUILT ON PYTHON INCLUDE 
	Reddit.
	Spotify.
	BitTorrent.
RELATIONSHP OF PYTHON WITH GIS
	Most software are written with python eg ARCGis and QGis.
	Python is open source and hence allows access to libraries like google maps.
	Python is easy to use.

calculate the volume of a sphere with radius 20mm. Output the result with a nice message

	#assign values to variable
	π = 3.142
	r = 20
	#write formula V=4/3.Π.r3
	V = (4 / 3) * π * ((r ** 3))

	print(str(V)  + " Good Job!")
	
allow the user to enter a radius for the above program and output the result.
	#assign values to variable
	π = 3.142
	r = input("radius=")
	a = int(r)
	#write formula V=4/3.Π.r3

	V = (4 / 3) * π * ((a ** 3))

	print(str(V)  + " Good Job!")
	
calculate the volume of a cylinder, allowing the user to input the height and radius, and then print the output with a nice message.
	#assign variables
	π = 3.142
	r = input("radius=")
	a = int(r)
	h = input("height=")
	b = int(h)

	#write formula V=πr2h

	V = π * ((a ** 2)) * b

	print(str(V) + " Amazing stuff!")
	
calculate the volume of a cone, allowing the user to input the height and radius, and then print the output with a nice message.
	#assign variables
	π = 3.142
	r = input("radius=")
	a = int(r)
	h = input("height=")
	b = int(h)

	#write formula V=πr2h/3

	V = π * (a ** 2) * ((b / 3))

	print(str(V) + " Atta Boy!!")
	
Conversion
calculate the fuel efficiency achieved on a journey, allowing the user to input the distance travelled and the amount of fuel used, give a nice output
	#assign variables
	d1 = input("distance A (km)=")
	a = int(d1)
	d2 = input("distance B (km)=")
	b = int(d2)
	f = input("fuel_used (Litres)=")
	c = int(f)
	#write formula E=(d2 - d1)/f

	E = ((b - a)) / c

	print(str(E) + " Well done!!")
	
create a Fahrenheit to Celsius converter, with user input
	#assign variables
	F = input("Fahrenhite=")
	a = float(F)


	#write Formula C = (F - 32) * 5/9
	C = ((a - 32)) * 5 / 9
	print(str(C) + "°C Wonderful!!")
	
create a Celsius to Fahrenheit converter, with user input
	#assign variables 
	C = input("Celsius=")
	b = float(C)

	#write formula F = (C * 9/5) +32
	F = ((b * 9) / 5) + 32
	print(str(F) +"°F Amazing Work!!")
